# Unity-MazeGen
Unity Project that generates a maze using recursive functions
This project is free to use but please give me credit if you use it.

This project consists of an array being generated using a recursive function and its data stored in an array file. The entrance is in an extremity of the array and the goal is always in the farthest possible square.

The walls are generated according to the array and the model is rotated accordingly.
The assets in the labyrinth are randomly place and they don't collide with each other, so if the chance of an object spawning is 1 it still have no negative impact or overlapse with other objects.
